## Implementation Guidelines
- Each feature is a vertical slice: backend, frontend, types, tests, docs.
- Document API endpoints, UI components, and business logic.
- Maintain clean code, regular code reviews, and thorough testing.
- Track progress phase by phase.

## Progress Tracking
- Current Phase: 1
- Last Updated: 2024-03-19
- Next Milestone: User Profile
- Blockers: None

## Notes
- Each feature should be implemented as a complete vertical slice
- Regular code reviews and refactoring
- Keep technical debt in check
- Maintain clean code principles
- Regular testing and documentation
